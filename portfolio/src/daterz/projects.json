The backend is developed using Java & Spring Boot and connects with a database using PostgreSQL. To ensure fast search speeds, I used JPA queries to optimize database searches. The frontend is developed using Angular and TypeScript. As for deployment, everything is done using AWS. Starting with my backend, I used Docker to containerize my backend and create an image, then I used ECS to deploy it and API Gateway to provide an https connection. For my frontend, I used S3 for static web hosting and CloudFront for an https connection. Lastly my database is hosted on RDS.",
